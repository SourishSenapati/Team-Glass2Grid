# Glass2Grid: Agricultural-Waste Derived Tinted Power Glass

### _Hult Prize 2026 Contender: "Unlimited Impact"_

## 🚀 Executive Summary

**Glass2Grid** transforms a massive environmental crisis—agricultural waste burning—into a sustainable energy solution for smart cities. We convert crop residues (Rice Husk, Bagasse) into **Tinted Power Glass**, a semi-transparent luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) that generates electricity while offsetting HVAC costs.

**Tagline:** _From Crop Residue to Smart Cities._

## 🌟 Key Features

1.  **Circular Economy Core:** We pay farmers for waste -> Stop burning -> Create high-tech glass -> Generate clean power.
2.  **Hybrid Material Tech:** Combines waste-derived Carbon Dots with stabilizing agents for commercial viability.
3.  **Smart City Ready:** Powers IoT sensors (Air Quality, Temp, Occupancy) without wires or batteries.

## 💻 How to Run the Demos

### 1. The Investor Pitch & Impact Simulator (Recommended)

This is a polished, interactive web/mobile ready landing page designed to WOW judges.

- **How to run:** Double-click `web/index.html` to open it in your browser.
- **What it does:** Calculates Farmer Income generated, CO2 saved, and Power output in real-time based on window surface area.

### 2. The Physics Simulation (Optional)

A detailed optical model for the technical dossier.

- **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  cd simulation
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  python lsc_model.py
  ```
- **Note:** If Python is not installed, rely on the Web Simulator for presentation purposes.

## 🏆 Hult Prize Strategy

- **Focus:** Social Supply Chain. Emphasize the **wealth transfer to rural farmers**.
- **differentiation:** Unlike standard solar, we are _aesthetic_ and _transparent_. Unlike standard glass, we pay for ourselves.
