# Market Expansion & Techno-Economic Analysis

## 1. Ancillary Application Vectors

Beyond the primary Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) vertical, the **Glass2Grid (G2G)** LSC technology leverages its unique _wavelength-selective transparency_ to unlock secondary markets inaccessible to opaque silicon.

### 1.1 High-Yield Application: Agrivoltaics

- **Concept:** Spectrally-Selective Greenhouse Glazing.
- **Physics:** The LSC film is tuned to absorb UV and Green wavelengths (500-550nm)—which contribute minimally to photosynthesis—and Stokes-shift them to Red/NIR (600-700nm), which maximizes Chlorophyll-A absorption.
- **Value Proposition:** Simultaneous increase in **Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR)** efficiency for crops and clean energy generation for automated irrigation systems.

### 1.2 Automotive & Mobility

- **Concept:** Auxiliary Load Compensation for EVs.
- **Physics:** Integration into sunroofs and sidelights to harvest high-incidence solar radiation.
- **Value Proposition:** Offsetting HVAC battery drain (range extension) and powering always-on IoT security sensors without tapping the main traction battery.

### 1.3 Infrastructure: Acoustic-Photovoltaic Barriers

- **Concept:** Transparent Noise Abatement Walls.
- **Value Proposition:** Utilization of massive highway surface area to power municipal street lighting, reducing grid dependence and maintenance OPEX.

## 2. Strategic Industrial Convergence

Lumicore operates at the nexus of three distinct industrial verticals, creating a compound value proposition.

1. **Next-Gen BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaics)**
   - **Current State:** Dominated by Opaque Silicon (aesthetic failure) or Organic PV (stability failure).
   - **Lumicore Fit:** **Disruptive Innovation.** We sacrifice absolute peak efficiency (vs. Silicon) for **Commercial Viability**—offering superior aesthetics, transparency, and a negative carbon material basis.

2. **Advanced Glazing & Fenestration**
   - **Current State:** Commodity market focused on thermal regulation (Low-E coatings).
   - **Lumicore Fit:** **Value-Add Layer.** We integrate into the existing lamination stacks of potential partners (Saint-Gobain, Guardian Glass) as a functional upgrade, not a replacement product.

3. **PropTech & Smart Building IoT**
   - **Current State:** High demand for edge sensing (Air Quality, Occupancy), limited by power delivery costs (cabling).
   - **Lumicore Fit:** **Enabling Infrastructure.** G2G windows provide "Power-at-the-Edge," eliminating the need for battery replacements or expensive conduit runs for smart sensors.

## 3. Social Impact Mechanics: The "Hult Model"

To align with the **Hult Prize 2026** mandate, our business model relies on a **Social Supply Chain**, incentivizing waste valorization over combustion.

- **The Agrarian Input Vector:**
  - **Problem:** Rice husk combustion releases PM2.5 and CO2 caused by a lack of economic alternatives.
  - **Solution:** Lumicore establishes a **biomass procurement network**, purchasing husk as a high-value precursor for Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs).
  - **Metric:** **Net Income Increase per Acre.** We monetize the waste stream, creating a measurable economic uplift for rural stakeholders.

- **Unit Economics of Sustainability:**
  - **Cost Advantage:** Utilizing waste feedstock reduces Precursor Cost by ~40% compared to synthetic chemical synthesis.
  - **Payback Period:** The marginal CAPEX of the G2G layer is offset within **<3.5 years** through the combined value of Electricity Generation and HVAC Load Reduction (IR Rejection).

- **The Circular Loop:**
  - Farm Waste $\rightarrow$ High-Value Nanomaterial $\rightarrow$ Urban Clean Energy $\rightarrow$ Reduced Grid Emissions.
