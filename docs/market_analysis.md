# Market Analysis & Expansion Strategy

## 1. Alternative Applications for Tinted Power Glass Technology

Beyond smart buildings, this luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) technology derived from agricultural waste has significant potential in other sectors:

- **Greenhouses (Agri-Voltaics):**
  - _Concept:_ The tint can be tuned to absorb UV/Green light (less useful for phtosynthesis) and emit equilibrium red light (optimal for chlorophyll absorption) while generating power for irrigation/sensors.
  - _Value:_ crop enhancement + energy generation.

- **Automotive Industry:**
  - _Concept:_ Sunroofs and side windows in EVs.
  - _Value:_ Trickle charging bettery systems or powering auxiliary IoT/Climate sensors without draining the range.

- **Sound Barriers / Highway Infrastructure:**
  - _Concept:_ Transparent or semi-transparent noise barriers on highways.
  - _Value:_ Large surface area for generation, reducing maintenance costs for street lighting.

- **Consumer Electronics & Wearables:**
  - _Concept:_ Charging covers for phones/tablets or smart watch faces using bio-derived carbon dots.
  - _Value:_ "Green" premium marketing + battery life extension.

- **Outdoor Advertising/Bus Shelters:**
  - _Concept:_ Self-powered illuminated advertising panels.
  - _Value:_ Grid independence for city infrastructure.

## 2. Closest Industries & Strategic Fit

The solution sits at the intersection of three major industries:

1.  **Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV):**
    - _Status:_ Fast-growing, typically silicon-based (opaque) or organic PV (expensive).
    - _Gap:_ Lack of truly aesthetic, transparent, and low-cost options.
    - _Our Fit:_ Disrupter offering lower efficiency but significantly better aesthetics and cost profile (using waste).

2.  **Architectural Glass Manufacturing:**
    - _Status:_ High volume, commodity market. Focusing heavily on "Smart Glass" (electrochromic) for heat control.
    - _Our Fit:_ A value-add layer that can be integrated into existing lamination processes of major players (Saint-Gobain, Asahi, Guardian).

3.  **Smart Building / PropTech:**
    - _Status:_ Intense demand for IoT sensors (Air quality, occupancy).
    - _Gap:_ Wiring is expensive; batteries are a maintenance nightmare.
    - _Our Fit:_ The "Power Glass" solves the power delivery problem for these devices, making it an enabler for PropTech.

## 3. Hult Prize 2026 Strategy: "Unlimited Impact"

To optimize for the Hult Prize (Social Entrepreneurship), the pitch must emphasize the _Social Supply Chain_ over just the technology.

- **The "Farmer First" Narrative:**
  - Don't start with "Smart Cities". Start with the Indian farmer.
  - Problem: Burning waste = Lost income + Health crisis.
  - Solution: We buy the waste, creating a _new revenue stream_ for rural communities.
  - Impact Metric: "$X returned to farmers per square meter of glass installed."

- **Unit Economics:**
  - Waste is cheap/free targeting. Carbon dot synthesis is scalable.
  - Show that the _marginal cost_ of adding this layer to a standard double-glazed unit is paid back in <3 years by energy savings (HVAC load reduction) + generation.

- **The "Circular Economy" Loop:**
  - Farm Waste -> High Tech City Material -> Energy -> Cleaner Air (both from less burning and green energy).
