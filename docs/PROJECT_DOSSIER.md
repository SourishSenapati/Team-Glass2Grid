# PROJECT DOSSIER: Agricultural-Waste–Derived Hybrid Tinted Power Glass

---

## 1. Project Title

**From Crop Residue to Smart Cities:**  
Agricultural-Waste–Derived Hybrid Tinted Power Glass for Self-Powered Smart Buildings

---

## 2. Executive Summary

India generates hundreds of millions of tonnes of agricultural waste every year, a large fraction of which is openly burned, causing severe air pollution, health damage, and carbon emissions. At the same time, urban buildings consume nearly 40% of total energy, yet their largest surface area — windows — remains passive.

This project proposes **Tinted Power Glass**, a building-integrated smart window system made using agricultural waste–derived carbon materials. Crop residues such as rice husk and sugarcane bagasse are converted into luminescent carbon-based materials that harvest sunlight. These materials are embedded inside tinted safety glass, where absorbed sunlight is guided to the window edges and converted into electricity using small solar strips.

The generated energy powers self-sustaining smart sensors, eliminating the need for wiring or frequent battery replacement. To overcome the performance limitations of pure waste-derived materials, we adopt a **hybrid material strategy**, where agricultural-waste carbon is performance-enhanced using safe engineered additives.

The solution simultaneously addresses:

- **Agricultural waste burning**
- **Urban energy inefficiency**
- **Smart building infrastructure gaps**

## 3. Problem Statement

### 3.1 Agricultural Waste Crisis

- India produces 600+ million tonnes/year of agricultural residue
- Open-field burning causes:
  - Air pollution
  - Smog
  - Respiratory illness
  - CO₂ and particulate emissions
- This waste is carbon-rich, yet largely underutilized.

### 3.2 Urban Building Energy Problem

- Buildings account for ~40% of energy consumption
- Rooftop solar is limited in dense cities
- Windows occupy large surface areas but:
  - Generate no energy
  - Require additional systems for smart monitoring

### 3.3 Technology Gap

There is no scalable solution that:

- Uses agricultural waste as a functional material
- Integrates into windows
- Generates energy
- Powers smart infrastructure

## 4. Proposed Solution

### 4.1 Core Idea

We convert agricultural waste into functional carbon-based light-harvesting materials, embed them into tinted architectural glass, and use the harvested energy to power smart building sensors.

| :------------------ | :----------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Material source** | Virgin materials   | Agricultural waste     |
| **Function**        | Passive            | Energy-generating      |

## 5. Agricultural Waste Utilization Strategy (CORE OF THE PITCH)

### 5.1 Waste Sources

Primary agricultural waste inputs:

- **Rice husk** (cellulose + silica rich)
- **Sugarcane bagasse** (lignin-rich, aromatic carbon)
- **Other crop residues**

These wastes are chosen because:

- They are abundant
- They are carbon-rich
- They are currently burned or discarded

### 5.2 Waste-to-Material Conversion (Conceptual)

Agricultural waste is processed into carbon-based luminescent materials (carbon nanostructures):

- Carbon atoms form small conjugated domains
- Surface functional groups enable light absorption
- Material absorbs UV/blue light and emits red light

This transforms low-value waste into **high-value functional material**.

---

## 6. Hybrid Material Strategy (Critical Engineering Upgrade)

### 6.1 Why Hybrid Is Necessary

Pure agricultural-waste–derived materials suffer from:

- Lower brightness
- Inconsistent optical properties
- Faster degradation

To ensure real-world performance, we adopt a **hybrid approach**.

### 6.2 Hybrid Design Philosophy

**Agricultural waste provides the carbon backbone.**  
**Engineered additives improve efficiency and stability.**

### 6.3 Hybrid Components

**Base (Mandatory):**

- Carbon material derived from agricultural waste

**Performance Enhancers (Additive, low percentage):**

- **Nitrogen dopants** → improve light emission efficiency
- **Red-emissive stabilizers** → reduce re-absorption losses
- **UV-protective nanoparticles** → extend lifetime

This ensures:

- Agricultural waste remains central
- Performance meets practical requirements

## 7. Working Principle of the Glass

1. Sunlight enters the tinted glass
2. Agricultural-waste–derived hybrid material absorbs UV/blue light
3. Material emits red light
4. Light is trapped and guided inside the glass
5. Light reaches the window edges
6. Small solar strips convert it into electricity
7. Electricity powers smart sensors

## 8. Transparency & Aesthetics

- **Transparency:** 70–80%
- **Appearance:** Similar to modern tinted architectural glass
- **Tint acts as:**
  - Heat reduction
  - Glare reduction
  - Energy harvesting layer
